# Skip-Bo
Ok, its been a while. Looking back at this code, its horrible, I hate it, its an atrocity to mankind. I'm gonna remaster this using a decision tree or something because these ifs are just awful, when I came back here it was over 2000 lines. 
Working on a BST and then self balancing trees in CPPProjects right now, will help with the decision tree in here.
